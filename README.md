# Scala-and-Spark-learning
 
 ## Description
Took an Udemy course which went through the scala programming language and Apache Spark. This repository is the work I've done throughout the course. The entire course was not finished (90% completed). This is not a project but a tutorial for learning purposes.

 ## Course Material
This course goes through the following:
- Scala Basics (variables/constants, types, tuples ...)
- Scala Programming (loops, functions, control flow ...)
- Scala Collections (Arrays, Lists, Maps, Sets ...)
- Spark DataFrames (Operations, dates and time, group by, aggregate, missing data, ...)
- Spark Machine Learning (Classification, Clustering, Model Validation, Regression, etc...)

Of course, it also teaches about the fundamentals of functional programming such as:
-how functions work
-function chaining
-no states / immutability
-Recursion

## Feedback
I liked working with scala as a language and using the spark framework. This forced me to think differently about programming than I usually do and I can see how in certain cases functional programming can be very beneficial. The reason for not finishing the course and continuing using scala is due to market trends and the availability of scala jobs. In the end, I decided to refine my skills in Java instead since that is more in demand. I will continue to work with scala in the future as a hobby.
